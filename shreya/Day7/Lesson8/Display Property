In CSS there is a property which decides how the elements will be displayed on the page.
There are some elemnents wich takle whole line or whole block to themselves.(paragraph tag)
ANd some which only take the space that is required. (image,text box,button)
But these are their own charecteristics.

So the display properties are as follows:
display : block
Elements with display: block start on a new line and take up the full available width of their parent container.
They stack vertically, one after another.
You can set width, height, margin (all four sides), and padding (all four sides) for block-level elements.
Examples of default block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, and <ul>.

display: inline:
Elements with display: inline do not start on a new line and only occupy the width necessary for their content.
They flow horizontally within the same line as surrounding content.
You cannot effectively set width or height for inline elements, and top/bottom margin and padding will not affect the layout of surrounding elements.
Examples of default inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, and <em>.


display: inline-block:
Elements with display: inline-block combine characteristics of both block and inline elements.
Like inline elements, they do not start on a new line and flow horizontally with other content.
Like block elements, you can set width, height, margin (all four sides), and padding (all four sides) for inline-block elements, and these properties will be respected and affect the layout of surrounding elements.
This value provides more control over the dimensions and spacing of elements while still allowing them to appear on the same line.
