<!-- #use of span explained at the bottom -->

<!-- General Technique:
1.Create element with HTML
2.Stye with CSS one by one -->


<!-- HTML Entity:It lets us print special charecters:
If u Google html entity middle dot:
It will give u a html code which can be used later. -->

<!-- Many times we write the same style for different classes we can reduce it by creating a div or directly doing it for the tag
This is called cleaning the code by removing the duplication.
Whatever that is repeated can be written in the main div.eg font-style:'Arial'
margin:0px
CSS Specificity:If we have multiple lines settting the same property then there is priority that a browser follows
This specificity depends on the selectors:
The one that is most specefic is most likely to have the higher priority. -->

<!-- 
 text-decoration: underline;
    This applies underline to whole text if we want to apply css to some particular thing text element.
    Text element is a element which inside a line of a text  -->

    eg: I am shreya <strong>Revanwar</strong> <br>
    eg: I am shreya <b>Revanwar</b>  <br>
    eg: I am shreya <i>Revanwar</i>  <br>
    eg: I am shreya <sub>Revanwar</sub> <br>
    eg: I am shreya <sup>Revanwar</sup> <br>
    eg: I am shreya <em>Revanwar</em> <br>
    eg: I am shreya <mark>Revanwar</mark> <br>
    eg: I am shreya <span>Revanwar</span> <br>

    <!-- As other text elements do some or the other things span does not add any sort of style to ur code but a class can be declared here and then this can be used for stylinf in css -->

<!-- 
    In HTML there is no use of spaces and writing on next line, it will be printed without any drama.
    Even u write line add spaces purposly it will combine all the spaces together and print it as 1 space -->

    <!-- Check Output -->
     <!-- To deal with this u can always add margin on the text -->
