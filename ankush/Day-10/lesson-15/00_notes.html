* position : absolute -> it also takes the same values as position(fixed) ,
* for position fixed the element placed for the browser window but for position absolute the element is place on the page 
* page in the part of the browser window that moveable when we scoll it 
* position fixed -> once fixed doesn't move but absolute it is different 

# generally in css when the element A which is written below the element B will appear the element A will appear on the element B
* Z-INDEX : determines which element appear front and which will appear behind , higher z index will appear at front 


# another key feature  :
* soo if wrote position absolute under a another element it will be places absolute to that element but that parent element should be fixed 

# position relative 
* soo this will be relative to the element 
* we created the time length using position absolute inside the position relative soo when parent is relative it can be scrollable but the absolute part will be fixed there
