* position : fixed -> it get fixed and only takes required space it needed
* top -> from the top positioning from the browser window 
* similarily left , right and bottom -> positioning it from browser window 
* element get stretched when positioning is applied at a time in opposite directions
* dynamically its ok , keeps up different resolution 
* always have a space at the top of the page regardless whats the content below the header , for that use padding on the body tag ex: body{
    padding-top : 60px
}
* side bar - it is sticking at the left and bottom soo there value will be 0 and instead of the right we will use width , here too we have to apply padding-left on the body
