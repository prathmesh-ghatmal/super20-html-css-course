<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- void element : The elements where closing tag is not required  -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="">
     <!-- rel : defines the type of file we are going to link -->
     <!-- href we have to give the file that we are going link in html -->
      <!-- to link the file inside a folder -> folderName/fileName.extension that we have to link , this path is known has filepath -->

    <!-- we can also change the font using google font by adding a link of it in a head tag -->
