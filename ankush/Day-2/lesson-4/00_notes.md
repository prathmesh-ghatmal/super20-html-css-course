* spacing in the inside of the container - padding , which can be done in all the directions 
. Buttons my default have the padding of  6 6 in left right and 1 1 in top bottom
* margin - space in the outside of the element/container 
* border - defines the outline of the container , bydefault the size of the border is 1px , soo if we have to adjust with another container we can adjust it less by 1px 
* margin + border + padding = css box model 
* align -> we used vertical align specifically to every container individually.
