     <!-- inline-Block element : takes only space that they required to take in a line of the website -->
    <!-- inline element : they are in a line , no element is places on the new line  -->
     <!-- Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block they are. -->
