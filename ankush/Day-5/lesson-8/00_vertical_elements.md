# The vertical-align property can be used in two contexts:

* To vertically align an inline-level element's box inside its containing line box. For example, it could be used to vertically position an image in a line of text.
* To vertically align the content of a cell in a table.
* Note : that vertical-align only applies to inline, inline-block and table-cell elements: you can't use it to vertically align block-level elements.
